### Templates
[Atomic Design by Brad Frost](https://atomicdesign.bradfrost.com/chapter-2/)
#### Definition
Templates are page-level objects that place components into a layout and articulate the design’s underlying content structure [(2016, Frost)](https://atomicdesign.bradfrost.com/chapter-2/). They focus on the page’s underlying content structure rather than the page’s final content.

#### What to Add
- A combination of Grids
- A combination of Columns and Rows
- A combination of Containers with custom display types
