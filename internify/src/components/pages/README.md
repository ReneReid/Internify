### Pages
[Atomic Design by Brad Frost](https://atomicdesign.bradfrost.com/chapter-2/)
#### Definition
Pages are specific instances of templates that show what a UI looks like with real representative content in place [(2016, Frost)](https://atomicdesign.bradfrost.com/chapter-2/). They focus on the page’s underlying content structure rather than the page’s final content. In addition to demonstrating the final interface as your users will see it, pages are essential for testing the effectiveness of the underlying design system. It is at the page stage that we’re able to take a look at how all those patterns hold up when real content is applied to the design system.
